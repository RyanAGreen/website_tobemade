Welcome! I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. with a focus on carbonate chemistry and biogeochemical modeling. Specifically, I'm fascinated by the potential of [ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE)](https://www.dosi-project.org/wp-content/uploads/Alkalinity-Enhancement-Policy-Brief.pdf) as a tool for [marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR)](https://oceanvisions.org/ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal/).

Through my research, I've explored a range of projects related to OAE, from natural analogs **20,000 years ago** to simulating future OAE off the west coast of the United States. I'm also interested in using **carbon isotopes** as a tool for verifying carbon uptake after mCDR.

Outside of my research, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors. Some of my favorite activities include playing sports, cooking, and traveling with friends and family.

Here is a list of the programming languages I use and the scientific topics that I am interested in!
