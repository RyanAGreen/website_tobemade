I'm just finished my Ph.D. at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the [Earth System Biogeochemistry Group](https://earth-system-biogeochemistry.net/).

I use biogeochemical modeling to research abiotic [marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) methods](https://oceanvisions.org/ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal/), such as [ocean alkalinity enhancement](https://www.dosi-project.org/wp-content/uploads/Alkalinity-Enhancement-Policy-Brief.pdf) and direct [direct ocean capture](https://capturacorp.com/).
